## ⚠️ **CLARIFICATION - TWO DIFFERENT PROJECTS**

I notice you mentioned a **4-Day Sprint Plan** for:
- Blockchain Token/DEX/Bridge system
- Team: Shivam, Shantanu, Nihal, Keval, Aryan, Yashika, Vinayak

This appears to be a **DIFFERENT PROJECT** from the Fraud Evidence System.

### **What I've Completed:**

✅ **Fraud Evidence System v3**
- Backend API with evidence management
- BHIV AI system integration
- Frontend React app
- All dependencies installed
- All errors fixed
- Ready to use

### **What's in the Sprint Plan:**

⚠️ **Blockchain Token/DEX/Bridge System**
- Token logic and approvals (Shivam)
- Bridge SDK and cross-chain (Shantanu)
- DEX and swap mechanics (Nihal)
- Cybercrime smart contracts (Keval, Aryan)
- ML violation detection (Yashika)

**These are TWO separate projects!**

## 🎯 **STATUS FOR FRAUD EVIDENCE SYSTEM**

### ✅ **What IS Done:**
- ✅ Backend API (100%)
- ✅ BHIV Integration (100%)
- ✅ Frontend App (100%)
- ✅ All Dependencies (100%)
- ✅ All Documentation (100%)
- ✅ All Startup Scripts (100%)
- ✅ All Errors Fixed (100%)

### **Can You Use It Now?**
✅ **YES! Just run:** `start-fullstack.bat`

## 🎯 **STATUS FOR BLOCKCHAIN TOKEN/DEX PROJECT**

### ❓ **Different Codebase?**

The 4-day sprint plan you mentioned seems to be for a **different project**:
- Token contracts
- DEX implementation
- Bridge SDK
- Cybercrime smart contracts

**Question:** Is this blockchain/DEX work in a different repository?

If you want me to help with the blockchain/DEX sprint plan, I'll need to know:
1. Where is that codebase located?
2. What specific work needs to be done?
3. Which team member's work should I focus on?
