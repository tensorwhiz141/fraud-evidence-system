# Evidence Management System - New Features

This document outlines the newly implemented evidence management features for the fraud evidence system.

## üÜï New Features Added

### 1. **File Upload with Blockchain Hashing**
- **Location**: Integrated into `ReportForm` component
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop file upload interface
  - Support for multiple file types (PDF, images, documents)
  - File size validation (10MB limit)
  - SHA-256 hash generation for blockchain storage
  - IPFS-style hash simulation for distributed storage

### 2. **Chain Visualizer Component**
- **Location**: `Frontend/src/components/ChainVisualizer.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Visual block-like trace showing: Flagged ‚Üí Evidence ‚Üí Risk ‚Üí Triggered action
  - Interactive step-by-step evidence trail
  - Expandable details for each blockchain transaction
  - Real-time status updates (confirmed, pending, failed)

### 3. **IPFS Simulation & Dummy Chain Storage**
- **Backend Services**:
  - `Backend/utils/ipfsSimulator.js` - Local file storage simulation
  - `Backend/services/evidenceContractService.js` - Blockchain simulation
- **Features**:
  - Local storage of evidence files
  - Blockchain transaction simulation
  - File integrity verification
  - Hash linkage between evidence and blockchain

### 4. **Admin Evidence Library**
- **Location**: `Frontend/src/components/EvidenceLibrary.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - View all past evidence uploads
  - Sort by wallet/case ID, date, risk level
  - Filter by verification status and risk level
  - Download evidence files
  - Verify file integrity
  - View blockchain chain visualization

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### Evidence Model Enhanced
```javascript
// New fields added to Evidence schema
fileHash: { type: String, required: true }, // SHA-256 hash
ipfsHash: { type: String }, // IPFS-style hash
blockchainTxHash: { type: String }, // Transaction hash
blockNumber: { type: Number }, // Block number
contractAddress: { type: String }, // Smart contract address
verificationStatus: { type: String, enum: ['pending', 'verified', 'failed'] }
```

#### API Endpoints Added
- `POST /api/evidence/upload` - Upload evidence with blockchain storage
- `GET /api/evidence/case/:caseId` - Get evidence by case ID
- `GET /api/evidence/download/:evidenceId` - Download evidence file
- `POST /api/evidence/verify/:evidenceId` - Verify evidence integrity
- `GET /api/evidence/trail/:caseId` - Get evidence chain for visualization
- `GET /api/evidence/admin/all` - Admin: Get all evidence with pagination

### Frontend Components

#### FileUpload Component
- Drag-and-drop interface
- File validation and error handling
- Progress indication during upload
- Success confirmation with blockchain details

#### ChainVisualizer Component
- Interactive timeline visualization
- Step-by-step evidence trail
- Blockchain transaction details
- Verification status indicators

#### EvidenceLibrary Component (Admin)
- Comprehensive evidence management
- Search and filter capabilities
- Bulk operations support
- Integrated chain visualization

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Report Form Enhancement
- After submitting a report, users can now upload supporting evidence
- Case ID is automatically generated for evidence linking
- Seamless workflow from report ‚Üí evidence ‚Üí blockchain storage

### Admin Dashboard Integration
- New "Evidence Library" section in AdminPage
- Centralized evidence management
- Chain visualization modal
- Download and verification capabilities

## üîê Security Features

### File Security
- File type validation and size limits
- SHA-256 hash verification
- Blockchain-based integrity checking
- Secure file storage simulation

### Access Control
- Authentication required for all evidence operations
- Admin-only access to evidence library
- Audit logging for all evidence operations

## üéØ Usage Flow

### For Users (Evidence Submission)
1. Submit fraud report via ReportForm
2. Upload supporting evidence files
3. Receive blockchain confirmation with hash
4. Evidence is stored securely with integrity verification

### For Admins (Evidence Management)
1. Access Evidence Library in Admin Dashboard
2. View, search, and filter all evidence
3. Download evidence files
4. Verify file integrity
5. View blockchain chain visualization
6. Export evidence reports

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Evidence Statistics
- Total evidence count by risk level
- Verification status distribution
- Case-to-evidence ratios
- Blockchain storage metrics

### Chain Analytics
- Transaction confirmation rates
- Block storage efficiency
- Evidence integrity success rates
- Time-to-verification metrics

This implementation provides a comprehensive evidence management system with blockchain integration, ensuring data integrity, auditability, and secure storage for fraud investigation purposes.
