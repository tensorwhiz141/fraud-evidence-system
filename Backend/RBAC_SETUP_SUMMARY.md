All components of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system have been successfully implemented and tested.

---

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Configuration File ✅

### 3. Route Integration ✅
**File**: `backend/mocks/mockServer.js` (Updated)

Protected endpoints:
- `POST /api/evidence/upload` - requires `upload-evidence`

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Test as Different Roles

```bash
# As Guest (limited access)
curl -H "x-user-role: guest" http://localhost:5000/api/cases

# As User (can upload)
curl -X POST -H "x-user-role: user" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/evidence/upload \
  -F "caseId=CASE-2024-001" \
  -F "entity=0x742d..."

# As Investigator (can verify)
curl -H "x-user-role: investigator" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/evidence/abc123/verify

# As Admin (can delete)
curl -X DELETE -H "x-user-role: admin" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/cases/abc123
```

### Example 2: Expected 403 Response

```bash
# Try to delete as user (should fail)
curl -X DELETE -H "x-user-role: user" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/cases/abc123

# Response:
{
  "error": true,
  "code": 403,
  "message": "Forbidden: insufficient permissions",
  "details": {
    "requiredPermissions": ["delete-case"],
    "userRole": "user",
    "allowedRoles": ["admin", "superadmin"]
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-07T15:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## 🔧 How to Use

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
cd backend
docker-compose up
```

### 2. Test with Postman

1. Import `postman/rbac_test_collection.json`
2. Run the collection
3. All tests should pass

### 3. Test with cURL

```bash
# Success case
curl -H "x-user-role: admin" http://localhost:5000/api/cases

# Failure case
curl -H "x-user-role: guest" \
  -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/evidence/upload
```

### 4. Check Logs

The server logs all authorization attempts:
```
✅ Authorized access: { role: 'admin', actions: ['view-cases'], path: '/api/cases', method: 'GET' }
🚫 Unauthorized access attempt: { role: 'guest', requiredActions: ['upload-evidence'], path: '/api/evidence/upload', method: 'POST' }
```

## 📞 Support

### Getting Help
1. Read `RBAC_DOCUMENTATION.md` for detailed guide
2. Check `rbac-permissions.json` for current permissions

4. Check server logs for authorization attempts

### Common Questions

**Q: How do I add a new permission?**
A: Add to `rbac-permissions.json` in the `metadata.actions` array and assign to appropriate roles.

**Q: How do I test a specific role?**
A: Use `x-user-role` header: `curl -H "x-user-role: analyst" ...`

**Q: Why am I getting 403?**
A: Check the `details.allowedRoles` in the response to see which roles have access.

**Q: Can I have custom roles?**
A: Yes! Add them to `rbac-permissions.json` with appropriate permissions.
